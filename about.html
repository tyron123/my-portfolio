        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><strong>Hey, I’m Tyron — a UX designer who loves turning messy, complex systems into experiences that make sense.</strong></p>
        <p>I’m drawn to problems where humans and technology meet. Whether it’s helping someone do their job faster or simplifying a public service, I care about clarity, inclusion, and impact.</p>

        <h2>Why I Design</h2>
        <p>My UX journey started with a crash. About twenty years ago, I helped roll out SharePoint at work. A few power users uploaded 30–40 MB photos to every page — the whole intranet went down. That moment stuck with me: design isn’t decoration, it’s function. It’s how we make technology serve people, not frustrate them.</p>

        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>I bring everyone in early — engineers, PMs, support teams — because collaboration sharpens design. I take time to research, test, and iterate so what we build actually holds up in use. People I’ve worked with call me easygoing, detailed, and transparent. I like untangling complex systems and shaping them into something intuitive and human.</p>

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>Good design is inclusive, transparent, and accessible. When you design for the outliers — the 1% who are often left out — everyone benefits. I’m especially drawn to improving digital public services and civic tech. If design can make applying for healthcare, benefits, or immigration support less stressful, that’s impact that matters.</p>

        <aside class="philosophy">
          <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
          <blockquote>“Respect the terrain — but always move with purpose.”</blockquote>
          <p>In mountaineering, the mountain always wins. You adapt. Design’s the same — every product has its own terrain: legacy systems, user limits, internal politics. I map it, listen, and move with empathy and intent.</p>
